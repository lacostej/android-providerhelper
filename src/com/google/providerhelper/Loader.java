/**
 * Builds an object using fields extracted from an Android ContentProvider's
 * Cursor object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To use it, create a POJO instance that represents your rows, and for each ContentProvider column name (e.g.
 * "foo") which you wish to process, provide a method named setFoo(), i.e., the
 * field's name capitalized and prefixed by "set". This method must take one
 * argument, which must be of type int, long, String, float, or double,
 * depending on the type provided by the ContentProvider, which you have to know
 * because the ContentProvider doesn't expose them. If you want to process the
 * _id field, provide a set_id method.
 * Then instanciate a Loader parametrized with the type of your POJO instance
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Builder provides a constructor of one argument, an Android.database.Cursor.
 * This extracts fields from the Cursor and for each field xxx, calls your
 * setXxx method if provided, extracting the expected type of argument from the
 * Cursor.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because of Java constructor inheritance weirdness, if you add any more
 * constructors to your inheritor class, you must ensure that it also has a
 * zero-argument constructor, which however need not do anything.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class may be used standalone with Cursor objects obtained anyhow, and is
 * also designed to with the associated Reader class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here's an example of a small class which stores the phone number and time of
 * a phone call, and can be initialized using a Cursor from the CallLog.Calls
 * Content Provider, which contains "number" and "date" fields.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  public class Call {
 *    String phoneNumber;
 *    String date;
 *    public void setNumber(String number) {
 *      phoneNumber = number;
 *    }
 *    public void setDate(Long date) {
 *     this.date = 
 *       DateUtils.formatDateTime(this, date, DateUtils.FORMAT_SHOW_TIME|DateUtils.FORMAT_SHOW_DATE);
 *    }
 *    public String toString() {
 *     return "Called " + number + " at " + date;
 *    }
 *  }
 *  
 *  // elsewhere
 *  Cursor cursor = activity.managedQuery(CallLog.Calls.CONTENT_URI, ... );
 *  // ... navigate cursor ...
 *  Call call = new Call(cursor); // call.number and call.date are now set
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see Reader
